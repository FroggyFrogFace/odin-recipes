        <h2>Description</h2>
        These raspberry-lemon cupcakes are not too sweet with just the right amount of tartness. I used frozen raspberries but feel to use fresh raspberries. Easy to make and ready in less than 40 minutes. 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces Neufchatel cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 egg white, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 cup raspberries </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 9 cups in a cupcake tin with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>Cream Neufchatel cheese, butter, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg and egg white; beat until well combined. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and lemon extract.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture and beat until just combined. Fold in raspberries. Spoon batter into the prepared cupcake tin, filling each cup 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice together in a small bowl and drizzle over cooled cupcakes.</li>
        </ol>
